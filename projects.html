            <p>
              The google chrome AI extension, snipmind, is a project that me and a team have worked together on. It is designed to be able to assist the user with ease of reading a webpage and answering questions the user might have.

            <p>
              Crypto Investment Tracker is a project that I have worked on myself. It is a application that allows the user to keep track of their crypto with how they are changing and keep track of any profit margins they are meeting. It includes a feature that alerts the user in case of any significant changes.

            <p>
              The music player is a mini application that displays a small UI that lets the user play music from their spotify library. Rather than having the whole web application or app open, the user can have a mini player on the side of their screen that they can control the music with.
